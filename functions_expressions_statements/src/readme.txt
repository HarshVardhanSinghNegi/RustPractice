Order is not necessary while defining functions;
Main functions will be executed when code is executed (like in java).
Defining types is mandatory when defining parameters in functions.
functions are statements.
everything that can return or give a value is an expression. Eg: macro, function call, constants, block{}
no semi-colon in block means return.
for functions use -> to specify return type, we can use return keyword also then ; brcomes obsolete.
no need to specify the return type for block.
